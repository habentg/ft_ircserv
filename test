Memory issues:

Pre-requisite: All tests are done by valgrind --leak-check=full

Issue 1: Server closed when clients are still connected or initiated a communication.

Reproduce the bug:
1. Start the server
2. Connect from multiple clients (2....n)
3. Exit from the server with ctrl c



Issue 2: 
- NICK message is used to give user a nickname or change the previous
   one.

-  If a NICK message arrives at a server which already knows about an
   identical nickname for another client, a nickname collision occurs.
   As a result of a nickname collision, all instances of the nickname
   are removed from the server's database, and a KILL command is issued
   to remove the nickname from all other server's database. If the NICK
   message causing the collision was a nickname change, then the
   original (old) nick must be removed as well.

	4.6.1 Kill message
		KILL is used
		by servers when they encounter a duplicate entry in the list of valid
		nicknames and is used to remove both entries.




Issue 3:
- /join #bar,#foo

	I don't know if this is supposed to be handled but ours is not handling it.

Issue 4:
-  Once a user has joined a channel, they receive notice about all
   commands their server receives which affect the channel.  This
   includes MODE, KICK, PART, QUIT and of course PRIVMSG/NOTICE.
