/* The `send` function in C/C++ is used to send data over a socket.
It takes several parameters:

- **Socket file descriptor:** This is the file descriptor representing
	the socket over which data is sent.
- **Buffer pointer:** A pointer to the data that needs to be sent.
- **Data size:** The size of the data in bytes.
- **Flags:** Optional flags that control the behavior of the `send`
	function. It's commonly set to 0 for default behavior.

Here's an example of how `send` can be used: */

#include <sys/socket.h>

// Assuming you have a socket_fd representing the socket

void	snd(int socket_fd) {
	char *message = "Hello, server!";
	int message_size = strlen(message);

	int bytes_sent = send(socket_fd, message, message_size, 0);
	if (bytes_sent == -1) {
		perror("send failed");
		// Handle error
	} else {
		printf("Sent %d bytes\n", bytes_sent);
	}
}

/* This function is crucial for sending data from a client to a server
or between different parts of a networked application. */
