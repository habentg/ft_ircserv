/* `kqueue` is a scalable event notification interface primarily used in
BSD-based operating systems (like FreeBSD and macOS). It allows application
 to efficiently monitor changes or events happening in various sources such
 as files, sockets, processes, and more.

Key aspects of `kqueue`:
- **Efficiency**: Offers high performance when handling a large number of
descriptors or events.
- **Scalability**: It's designed to handle a large number of events efficiently.
- **Event-driven**: It enables the application to receive notifications
asynchronously when specific events occur.

Using `kqueue` involves creating a kernel queue, registering file descriptors
or other kernel objects to monitor, and waiting for events to occur. When an
event occurs, the application is notified, and it can take necessary action
based on the type of event received.

Here's a basic example of using `kqueue` to monitor file changes: */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/event.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
	int kq, file_descriptor;
	struct kevent change;
	struct kevent event;

	kq = kqueue();
	if (kq == -1) {
		perror("kqueue");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	file_descriptor = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
	if (file_descriptor == -1) {
		perror("open");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	EV_SET(&change, file_descriptor, EVFILT_VNODE, EV_ADD | EV_ENABLE | EV_CLEAR, NOTE_DELETE | NOTE_WRITE, 0, 0);

	if (kevent(kq, &change, 1, &event, 1, NULL) == -1) {
		perror("kevent");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	printf("Monitoring 'example.txt' for changes. Press enter to exit.\n");
	getchar(); // Wait for user input

	close(file_descriptor);
	close(kq);

	return 0;
}

/* In this example:
- `kqueue` creates a new kernel event queue.
- `open` opens a file for monitoring.
- `EV_SET` initializes the `change` structure to monitor changes in the
specified file (`example.txt`).
- `kevent` registers the file descriptor with the kernel queue and specifies
the events to monitor (file deletions and writes).

When a change occurs in the monitored file, the application will receive a notification.

Remember, the specifics of using `kqueue` can be more complex based on the
events you want to monitor and how you handle those events in your application. */
