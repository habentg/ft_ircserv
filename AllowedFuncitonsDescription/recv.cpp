/* The `recv` function in C/C++ is used to receive data from a socket.
It's the counterpart to the `send` function and allows a program to
receive data sent over a network.

It typically takes these parameters:

- **Socket file descriptor:** Represents the socket from which the data is received.
- **Buffer pointer:** A pointer to the buffer where the received data will be stored.
- **Buffer size:** The maximum number of bytes to receive.
- **Flags:** Optional flags that control the behavior of the `recv` function.
It's commonly set to 0 for default behavior.

Here's an example of how `recv` can be used: */

#include <sys/socket.h>

// Assuming you have a socket_fd representing the socket
void	rcv(int socket_fd) {
	int socket_fd;
	char buffer[1024];
	int buffer_size = sizeof(buffer);

	int bytes_received = recv(socket_fd, buffer, buffer_size, 0);
	if (bytes_received == -1) {
		perror("recv failed");
		// Handle error
	} else if (bytes_received == 0) {
		printf("Connection closed\n");
		// Handle connection closure
	} else {
		buffer[bytes_received] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the received data
		printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);
	}
}

/* This function is crucial for receiving data in networked applications, allowing
the program to process information received from other networked entities. */
